# Exercise 1

In this exercise you will be cleaning up the commit history of a branch.

## Scenario

The master branch contains a number of work-in-progress commits, made by a developer who just had to save some work in a hurry while working on a feature.

In order to make a commit history that is suitable for others to read, you must clean it up.

## Tasks

- Squash the five newest commits into one.
- The squashed commit must have exactly the commit message "close #321".
- The branch should only contain two commits: the initial commit and your squashed commit.
