# Exercise 7

## Scenario

You are working on a project that has a lot of commits over time.
You have been tasked with the database connection, and work on your own branch for a while.
You are now ready to merge your changes back to the main branch.
Your team has decided to have a linear history, so you need to abide to that rule.

:bulb: What is a linear history?
Linear history simply means that all commits in a Git repository come one after another.
I.e. you will not find any merges of branches with independent commit histories, nor merge commits.

## Tasks

- Make sure your branch `feature/database-connection` has a linear history with origin/main.
- If git is suggessts a commit message, do not change the wording.
