# Exercise 4

In this exercise you will be cleaning up a git repository, removing work-in-progress and removing a bad commit.

## Scenario

You have been experimenting with some new changes.

Ultimately you decide that your experiment doesn't work, and you want to go back to the state from before you started experimenting.

But you are left with some work-in-progress files as well as a commit that you don't want to keep.

## Tasks

- Remove the unstaged changes
- Remove the staged changes
- Make `master` go back to the commit before the bad commit
- Make git track bfile.txt and make a commit that adds the file
- You should have either 2 or 4 commits on `master` branch when you are done
